Clone, open a powershell terminal in the repo root, and execute ```.\run```.

To change the signals, modify ```num_graphs``` and add/remove/modify the corresponding signal strings.

To add a new set of signals, copy the file and give it a different name, then change the signals and add that file to ```run.ps1```.
